# Airbnb_Berlin_data_analysis_python
This is the analysis of Airbnb Berlin to analyze what variables may impact the price of housing, which districts are most popular among tourists and search for any noticeable patterns and trends in the data.
# Introduction 
Airbnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. The platform is accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking.

Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. The metro area population of Berlin in 2022 is 3,5 Million and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, as well as among European cities in general. Every year Berlin attracts around 13.5 million visitors to its hotels and guest houses and belongs to the exclusive league of cities with 33 million overnight stays a year.

- Scipy
- Numpy
- Folium
- Geopy
- Geoplot

# Time-Series Analysis
A time series analysis was learned during this project. Since the data for Airbnb analysis only contained forecasted data from 2022 to 2023, additional data was used for the time series analysis.
This Data is downloaded from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/TOUR_OCC_MNOR__custom_3522408/default/table?lang=en . It contains monthly data of Net occupancy rate of bed-places and bedrooms in hotels and similar accommodation in Germany from 1990 to 2022(NACE Rev. 2, I, 55.1).

# Deliverables
Included in the respository is:

- Scripts used to wrangle and analyzethe data
- Tableau Public was used to create a dashboard to present data. Not all script results were presented in the story, only relevant analysis. Link https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ambicca.timilsena
